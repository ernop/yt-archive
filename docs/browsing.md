# Browsing the archive

Parent: [agents.md](../agents.md).

## List order

The archive home page defaults to **Recently gotten**, ordered by the time
yt-archive first acquired each video, newest first. Reprocessing an existing
video does not change that acquisition time.

The sort control is URL-backed and works together with search. It offers:

- recently gotten;
- first gotten;
- original YouTube upload date, newest first;
- title, A–Z;
- channel, A–Z.

Unknown sort values fall back to Recently gotten. The server-rendered page and
the live refresh after a queued download use the same query and sort, so the
list cannot silently change order. Acquisition timestamps are shown on every
card, with the browser converting them to local time.

This keeps the default focused on newly added archive material while retaining
predictable, low-friction ways to find older or alphabetically grouped items.
